1. Prioritize objective data over narrative. Use stats, not vibes.
2. Every insight must be backtestable. No exceptions.
3. Track implied probabilities and compare against modeled probabilities.
4. Seek variance between market odds and model outputs; this is your alpha.
5. Disregard emotional bias (e.g., favorite teams or players).
6. Model assumptions must be explicitly stated and version-controlled.
7. Risk-adjusted return (e.g., EV, Sharpe, Kelly) > raw return.
8. Never bet or trade if expected value is negative or unclear.
9. All feature importance must be interpreted before deployment.
10. Data latency and source quality must be verified before use.
11. Price inefficiencies decay fast. Automate alerts when found.
12. Use ensemble models if predictive power stagnates.
13. Validate models out-of-sample before committing capital.
14. Use Monte Carlo simulations to stress-test edge durability.

15. Track your live alpha performance; adapt fast or kill the model.
